This assignment is done by me. To do this assignment, I have created .sh file in which I have written all commands as per the requirement of assignment. 


In this assignmnet, I have run some script to complete below task..



Exercise_1 - Write a shell script that prints “Shell Scripting is Fun!” on the screen

Exercise_2 - Modify the shell script from exercise 1 to include a variable. The variable will hold the
contents of the message “Shell Scripting is Fun!”
